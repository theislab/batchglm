            has to sum to zero. This constraint is enforced by binding one parameter
            to the negative sum of the other parameters, effectively representing that
            parameter as a function of the other parameters. This dependent
            parameter is indicated by a -1 in this array, the independent parameters
            of that constraint (which may be dependent at an earlier constraint)
            are indicated by a 1. You should only use this option
            together with prebuilt design matrix for the scale model, dmat_scale,
            for example via de.utils.setup_constrained().
        - dict:
            Every element of the dictionary corresponds to one set of equality constraints.
            Each set has to be be an entry of the form {..., x: y, ...}
            where x is the factor to be constrained and y is a factor by which levels of x are grouped
            and then constrained. Set y="1" to constrain all levels of x to sum to one,
            a single equality constraint.

                E.g.: {"batch": "condition"} Batch levels within each condition are constrained to sum to
                    zero. This is applicable if repeats of a an experiment within each condition
                    are independent so that the set-up ~1+condition+batch is perfectly confounded.

            Can only group by non-constrained effects right now, use constraint_matrix_from_string
